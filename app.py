You are an expert in analyzing development and environmental project documents.

From the following section of a report, extract **all possible geospatial practices**, 
even if they are uncertain, small-scale, or only partially described.

For this task:
- Be *comprehensive* and *inclusive*: list everything that might qualify.
- Look for mentions of geospatial, mapping, GIS, remote sensing, spatial databases, or digital tools.
- Also search for or near keywords like: adoption, project, new, achievements, introduce, developed, implemented, upgraded, plan, modernize, establish.
- If any practice seems related, list it.

For **each distinct practice**, output with the following structure:

[index number].
- **Practice Title:** A short, clear title (5â€“12 words)
- **Country:** [country mentioned or "Unknown"]
- **Partner/Organization:** [organization(s) involved or "N/A"]
- **Theme:** [choose one: Energy | Natural Resource Management | Connectivity | Disaster Risk Management | Climate Change Mitigation | Social Development | Spatial Governance | Agriculture | Urban Planning]
- **Practice Description:** [concise paragraph explaining what was done, developed, or planned and what technology/data was used]
- **Supporting Quote:** [short direct quote from this section supporting this practice]

List **all** relevant practices found in this section.  
Do not summarize; output each one in the above structure.
